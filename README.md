## Raspberry

Raspberry is used to print over the network. To access octoprint (the webinterface for printing) enter the IP-address of the raspberry into a webbrowser (edge, chrome, firefox, etc..). Your client has to be in the same network as the raspberry!

For best experience, setup a static IP-address for the raspberry: https://raspberrypi-guide.github.io/networking/set-up-static-ip-address
